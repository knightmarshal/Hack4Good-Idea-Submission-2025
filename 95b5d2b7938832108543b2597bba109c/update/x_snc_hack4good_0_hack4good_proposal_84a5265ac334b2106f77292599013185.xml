        <potential_impact><![CDATA[<p>SafeRoute aims to enhance women’s safety by combining technology and community vigilance. It provides real-time tracking, SOS alerts, and automated notifications to nearby volunteers or authorities. The solution not only enables faster emergency response but also builds safer routes and community confidence. Long term, data insights can help city planners identify unsafe zones and prioritize streetlight or patrol improvements.</p>]]></potential_impact>
